<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h4>Why do I have to register?</h4>
  <p>
    Registration is necessary for your comfort and also for the necessary formalities:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every inforequest must include the postal address.</li>
    <li>In case of refusal, the institution will send a written resolution, not an email.</li>
    <li>
      If you would send an appeal, that must be in a written form (yes, really, on a paper -- we
      did not made that up).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
