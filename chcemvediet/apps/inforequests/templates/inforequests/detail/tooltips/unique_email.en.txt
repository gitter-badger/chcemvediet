This is a unique email adress, which was generated for this request. Why is it necessary? The
institutions often do not reply to email directly, but write a new email instead. Sometimes they
answer from a different address, for example if the request was forwarded to another person to act
upon. The unique address enables us to track the conrete request, because all emails, which arrive
to this address, are related to this request.
